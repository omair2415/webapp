The app is a web application designed to run on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. It is built to provide a secure and robust platform for various online services.

The server runs on CENTOS, a popular and reliable Linux distribution known for its stability and security features. CENTOS provides a solid foundation for hosting web applications, ensuring that the app is running on a secure environment.

To ensure the security of the application and the data it handles, strong cybersecurity practices are implemented throughout the app.

- Secure Communication: The web app enforces encrypted communication using SSL/TLS protocols. This ensures that all data transferred between the server and the client is protected against eavesdropping and tampering.

- Authentication: The app employs robust authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts. This includes strong password policies, password hashing with salt, and the option for two-factor authentication (2FA). It also provides session management to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.

- Authorization and Access Control: The app implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific features and data based on user roles and permissions. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information and functionalities.!
