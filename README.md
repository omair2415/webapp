# webapp
Hello!
thank you for browsing my github?
this is a simple webserver backed by a centos 7 virtual machine 
this is my first project 
The website is a template is made by Carlos Alvarez from www.free-css.com
ive personalized the source code 
this is just a beginner website so there is not many data in the front end 
You will need Mariadb to make the backend work 
enjoy!
